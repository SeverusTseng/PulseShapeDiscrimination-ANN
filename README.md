# PulseShapeDiscrimination-ANN
Pulse Shape Discrimination using Neural Network Algorithm

In Nuclear and Particle Physics experiments, the pulse signal carries the most comprehensive and detailed information from the detector. Nuclear pulse information extraction is an important technology in the field of nuclear electronics. With the development of high-speed, high-precision ADC (Analog-to â€“Digital Conversion) technology, nuclear pulse sampling and digital processing has become a trend. In this dissertation, the author focuses on using an existing high-speed AD acquisition card for high-speed waveform sampling, and to achieve real-time digital signal processing in the FPGA.  This work contains three main contributions. First, to achieve real-time digital signal processing in the FPGA, the author writes logic engineering in the ISE Suite using HDL languages (Verilog and VHDL), and download it to the FPGA after compiling. Second, the author implements timing simulation of the FPGA logic in Modelsim. Simulation is an important part of hardware engineering design. Third, the author writes the data acquisition software for the high-speed AD acquisition card based on the LabWindows/CVI environment, and realize the command sending and data storing using the acquisition software. Last, the author tests the high-speed AD acquisition card and completes the pulse sampling and digital processing of the signal generator and two detectors, then uses MATLAB to analyze the data.
